# Calculator-in-python
Create a simple calculator using Python's `tkinter`. The GUI includes input fields for two numbers, options to select an operation (add, subtract, multiply, divide), and a result display. Handles errors like non-numeric input and division by zero. Final output is a single `.py` file with no external dependencies.
